# VisionX: Real-time Object Detection System

VisionX is a Python-based real-time object detection system that harnesses the power of TensorFlow and OpenCV for efficient video processing. This project provides functionalities for detecting objects in both images and video streams.


You can customize the project by:

- Training your own object detection model.
- Adding support for different object detection frameworks.
- Extending functionalities for specific use cases.
